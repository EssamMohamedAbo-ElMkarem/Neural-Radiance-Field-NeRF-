# Neural Radiance Field(NeRF)
A neural radiance field (NeRF) is a fully-connected neural network that can generate novel views of complex 3D scenes, based on a partial set of 2D images.

There is no doubt that there has been a great deal of research on 3d imaging and all other computer vision applications that would enhance our lives in the very near future. That's why I've put an effort here trying to wrap the implementation provided by Aritra Roy Gosthipaty up with a quick explanation of the paper itself to put it as a milestone for anyone trying to dig into the topic from an applicable prespective. I've also modified the architecture of the neural network a little bit to improve the performance of the model. I really appretiate the great work done here in this paper by the researchers as actually the preliminary results are really promising and of course there has been many improvements in the field when it comes to NeRFs but this paper is considered a really good start to dig deeper into the topic.
